# Battery Life Check

This PowerShell Script for NinjaRMM checks the user device for the current Battery Life and saves it to a custom field called "batterylifecheck".

If no battery was detected then it will display "No Battery".


You have to add the custom field "batterylifecheck" otherwise the script won't work.
